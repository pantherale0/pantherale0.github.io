## Notes

*   The "Rate" is the cost per cubic meter of water used.
*   The "Standing Charge" is a fixed annual charge.
*   "WaterSure" tariffs are charged annually, not per cubic meter.
*   "Custom" tariffs require you to manually enter the rate in the integration's configuration. This is useful if your tariff is not listed or if it changes.

This information is based on the currently available data within the integration. Tariff details may change, so it's always best to check your latest bill from Anglian Water for the most accurate information.
