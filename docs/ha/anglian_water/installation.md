# Installation

The recommended way to install this integration is through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store). Because this is a custom repository, you'll need to add it to HACS manually before you can install the integration. If you don't have HACS installed, please follow the [HACS installation instructions](https://hacs.xyz/).

Once you have HACS installed:

1.  In Home Assistant, go to **HACS** on the menu bar.
2.  Click the **three dots** in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3.  Add the following information:
    *   **Repository:** `https://github.com/pantherale0/haanglianwater`
    *   **Category:** `Integration`
4.  Click **Add**.
5.  Search for `Anglian Water`
6.  Select the `Anglian Water` integration and click **Install**.
7.  Restart Home Assistant.

After restarting, you can configure the integration through the Home Assistant Integrations page (Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration).
